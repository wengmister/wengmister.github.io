                    <p>The Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots (LIDAR Lab) led by Prof. Ye Zhao at GaTech focuses research on robotic system and interactions.</p>
                    <p>While in LIDAR, I led a sub-team of 12 undergraduate students and worked on designing and integrating a biomimetic upper body robot, Athena.</p>
                    <p>My team focused on designing and characterizing mechatronics systems. Emulating human muscle architecture, we used linear actuators to command 28 degrees of freedom on the system. I also managed CAD repositories and optimized the structure using topology optimization for maximum weight reduction while maintaining system stiffness.</p>

                    <p>The Exoskeleton and Prosthetic Intelligent Controls (EPIC) Lab at Georgia Tech, led by Professor Aaron Young, is devoted to the design and improvement of powered orthotic and prosthetic control systems.</p>
                    <p>While in EPIC, I worked on the Assistive Hip Exoskeleton project as an undergraduate RA. I designed and machined the housings and most major components on the series elastic actuators of the hip exo. </p>
                    <p>With the rest of the team, we developed experiments to characterize the performance of the system by collecting userâ€™s metabolic cost of walking under different system settings. I was also responsible for system setup and data collection.</p>

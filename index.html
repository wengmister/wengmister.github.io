            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm a versatile engineer with heavy interest in medical and surgical robots. A team player with strong analytical and problem solving skills, I thrive in cross functional teams to leverage solid mechanical design and prototyping expertise to find creative solutions to engineering challenges.</p>
            <p>My passion lies in robotic system development, with solid experiences spanning across mechanical, electrical, system integration and design. Throughout the years working in robotics R&D, I have acquired a skillset suited for turning product design inputs into engineering results. I'm looking forward to pushing the boundaries of robot-assisted surgery and transform the future of healthcare.</p>
            <p>I'm currently studying MS in Robotics at Northwestern University, while working part-time for my employer, Johnson & Johnson MedTech.</p>

                    <p>The Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots (LIDAR Lab) led by Prof. Ye Zhao at GaTech focuses research on robotic system and interactions.</p>
                    <p>While in LIDAR, I led a sub-team of 12 undergraduate students and worked on designing and integrating a biomimetic upper body robot, Athena.</p>
                    <p>My team focused on designing and characterizing mechatronics systems. Emulating human muscle architecture, we used linear actuators to command 28 degrees of freedom on the system. I also managed CAD repositories and optimized the structure using topology optimization for maximum weight reduction while maintaining system stiffness.</p>

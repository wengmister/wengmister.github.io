Reverse the order of paragraphs in intro

Neocis short intro
- a little too listy and packs too much info
- Could be more narrative given that there's a resume

HB intro
- third paragraph a little listy - GT context not very necessary
    - perhaps put it with the timing to contextualize it

LIDAR lab
- Context first
    - we used linear acutator .... emulate

EPIC
- Last sentence currently feels dangling - could make it into the full page description

GAP
- Add some more details on how I did it



# resume
JNJ - REMOVE ENGINEERING SUPPORT
- remove "implementing"
- "other documentation"

Neocis - 
Senior position - reduce the technical details in resume
- Impacts - leave the important ones, 
ME role - cut down neocis intro -> a little repeatetive with the senior role.
- Focus the first parts into the robot arm project
- OEM part - take away second sentence
- Probably take away the engg SUPPORT
- Combine the mentor one with the senior role

Patents - highlight them in projects - not necessarily numbers

LIDAR - 
- Put integration part in portfolio

Consider taking the GT Motorsports and older htings away

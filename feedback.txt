Reverse the order of paragraphs in intro

Neocis short intro
- a little too listy and packs too much info
- Could be more narrative given that there's a resume

HB intro
- third paragraph a little listy - GT context not very necessary
    - perhaps put it with the timing to contextualize it

LIDAR lab
- Context first
    - we used linear acutator .... emulate

EPIC
- Last sentence currently feels dangling - could make it into the full page description

GAP challenge
- Add some more details on how I did it

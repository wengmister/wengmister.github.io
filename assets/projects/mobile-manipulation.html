        <p>Mobile Manipulation was the final challenge of the ME449: Robotic Manipulation course at Northwestern University.</p>
        <p>Using robotic manipulation, forward kinematics, and linear control techniques we learned in class, I created a simulation in CoppeliaSim. The simulation demonstrated a KUKA youBot moving a box from one location to another with precision and efficiency.</p>

            <p>Given the desired initial and final target positions and orientations, I first generated the target trajectory using quintic polynomial interpolation.</p>
            <p>Next, I constructed the body Jacobian for the KUKA youBot and used its pseudoinverse to calculate the necessary configurations to move the robot from its current state to the target position.</p>

            <p>Using the calculated joint configurations, I designed a PI controller to move the robot from its initial to its desired configuration. The controller was tuned to minimize 6-dimensional motion control errors and ensure smooth motion.</p>
            <p>The simulation works by computing the difference between the desired and actual joint configurations. The PI controller then generates a control signal to move the robot to the desired configuration through Euler integration.</p>

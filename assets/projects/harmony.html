        <p>
            At Harmonic Bionics, I worked on the Harmony SHR, a 14-DoF upper-extremity rehabilitation robot 
            designed to support natural arm movement. My role combined mechanical design, analysis, and 
            prototype development.

        <p>
            I contributed to key mechatronic subsystems, designed custom linear-actuator assemblies and handheld 
            devices, and built fixtures for sensor and mechanism testing. I also performed structural and fatigue 
            analysis using FEA to validate component performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond hardware, I helped establish the company's R&D infrastructure, launching the machine shop, 
            writing safety procedures, and training engineers on prototyping equipment.

            <p>During my time at Harmonic Bionics, I contributed to the development of the Harmony SHR, an advanced upper extremity rehabilitation robot. My responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design of major mechatronic systems using various manufacturing techniques</li>
                <li>Development of handheld interface devices and custom linear actuator systems</li>
                <li>Material validation through simulation and experimental testing</li>
                <li>Integration of mechanical and electrical systems for prototype development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Harmony SHR is designed to facilitate natural movement patterns during rehabilitation, allowing therapists to deliver high quality care while collecting objective patient data.</p>

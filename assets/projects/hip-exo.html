        <p>Working in the EPIC Lab at Georgia Tech, I contributed to the development of an assistive hip exoskeleton designed to reduce the metabolic cost of walking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design and fabrication of series elastic actuator housings and components</li>
            <li>Development of experimental protocols for system characterization</li>
            <li>Collection and analysis of metabolic cost data under various conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This research aimed to develop more effective assistive devices for individuals with mobility impairments, with a focus on improving energy efficiency during walking.</p>

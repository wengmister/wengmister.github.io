            The Monarch Platform is a major breakthrough in robotic-assisted surgery, especially 
            for minimally invasive procedures involving the lungs and kidneys.

            As a senior mechanical engineer currently working at J&J, I am mainly responsible for 
            system development of the Monarch Surgical Platform, the first robotic platform for 
            minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the lungs and kidneys.

            I work on a variety of projects focused on the robotic arm and instrument manipulator, 
            addressing both hardware and software challenges. Additionally, I support the hardware 
            team in advancing the overall platform development.

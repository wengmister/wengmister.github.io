        <p>
            At Johnson & Johnson MedTech, I work as a Senior Mechanical Engineer on the Monarch Surgical 
            Platform—the first robotic system for minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic lung and kidney procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            I focus on the robotic arm and instrument manipulator, leading mechanical development, calibration 
            fixture design, and system validation. I also collaborate with the controls and software teams to 
            build C++/Python calibration tools and prototype admittance-control behaviors for surgeon studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond core arm development, I support cross-functional system integration and contributed to a 
            novel fluid-management subsystem for urology applications. My work helps shape next-generation 
            surgical robotics from early concept through verification.

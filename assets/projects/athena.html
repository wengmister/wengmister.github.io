        <p>As team lead for the Athena project at Georgia Tech's LIDAR Lab, I managed the development of a complex biomimetic upper body robot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Led a team of 7 undergraduate students in system design and integration</li>
            <li>Implemented a 28-DOF system using linear actuators to mimic human muscle architecture</li>
            <li>Managed CAD repositories and performed topology optimization for weight reduction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Athena project aims to advance our understanding of human-like movement and control in robotic systems, with potential applications in prosthetics and human-robot interaction.</p>

        <p>I have been interested in exploring ways how human could establish telepresence with robots.</p>
        <p>In this project, I explored the feasibility of teleoperating the Franka Emika Research (FER) 
            robot using a few different methods - game controller, and VR headset.</p>
        <p>This project was inspired by <a href="https://graham-clifford.com/Robot-Arm-Teleoperation-Through-Computer-Vision-Hand-Tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graham Clifford's work</a> on using computer vision hand tracking to teleoperate a robot arm.</p>

                To initially explore the feasibility of teleoperating the robot,
                I implemented a simple controller teleoperation with a XBox controller. 
            </p>
            <p>
                ROS2 provides a simple interface to provide joystick input to the robot - <code>joy_node</code>.
                This node allows me to bridge the input from the joystick to differential commands - which is then
                mapped to the robot's end-effector movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, joystick input is limited to the 4 tilting axes on the two joysticks - which is lacking
                compared to the 6-DOF of the robot's end-effector. Nonetheless, this is a good starting point to
                explore the feasibility of teleoperating the robot using low level controller.

                In order to teleoperate the robot using VR headset, I used the OXR Hand Tracking rig to track 
                the hand's pose and orientation. Using this pose and orientation information, I computed a wrist vector
                and used it to command the robot's end-effector movement.
            </p>

                This is currently a WIP prototype built with <code>moveit-servo</code> package in ROS2. Since this isn't
                deployed on a realtime computer, it's performance is currently suboptimal.
                I plan to reimplement it with lower level API on a realtime PC soon.

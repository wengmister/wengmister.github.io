        <p>At Neocis, I was heavily involved in developing the second generation of the Yomi surgical system, the only FDA-cleared robotic device for dental implant surgery. My major contributions included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design and development of joint actuators for a 7-DOF robotic arm</li>
            <li>Creation of compact robot end-effector for tool integration and user interaction</li>
            <li>Implementation of kinematic analysis and simulation for joint load optimization</li>
            <li>Development of calibration algorithms and inverse kinematics solver to enable obstacle avoidance capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Yomi system provides haptic guidance to dental surgeons while maintaining their direct control of the surgical instruments, combining the precision of robotic technology with the expertise of human practitioners.</p>

        <p>
            At Neocis, I helped develop the Yomi S platform, the only FDA-cleared robotic system for dental 
            implant surgery. My work centered on mechanical design, system integration, and calibration.
        </p>
        <p>
            I engineered the platform's main actuated guidance arm, designed multiple generations of compact 
            joint actuators for a 7-DoF robot, and built the prototypes used in testing. I also created a 
            human-robot-interface end-effector providing haptic and visual feedback for surgical guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
            To improve system accuracy, I developed Python-based kinematic simulators and a supervised-learning 
            calibration method. I contributed across design reviews, documentation, and onboarding, helping move 
            the next-generation system toward production.

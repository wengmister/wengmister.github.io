        <p>Impedance control is central to enabling safe and compliant robot interaction. I like to think of it as shaping a robot's behavior through a virtual spring-mass-damper system, helping it respond naturally to unexpected forces.</p>
        <p>This approach is especially important for robots that work closely with people, such as exoskeletons and collaborative arms. The Harmony SHR exoskeleton pictured here is a great example of a system that benefits from impedance-based control.</p>

            <p>In this project, I experimented with impedance control in both joint space and task space. Task-space control quickly became the most intuitive to work with.</p>
            <p>It lets the end-effector follow a desired trajectory while still yielding to external forces, making the behavior feel smooth rather than rigid. Disturbances are rejected gracefully, and the robot stays responsive.</p>
            <p>This setup also allows stiff tracking in task space while keeping the null space compliant, enabling more natural and adaptable motion.</p>

            <p>Bilateral teleoperation is a natural application of impedance control. A master device guides a follower robot, and the operator feels the forces the follower encounters.</p>
            <p>Using a joint-space impedance proxy, I was able to create a simple yet effective haptic loop. When the master and follower robots share similar kinematics, this method works surprisingly well and feels intuitive to operate.</p>
            <p>This setup allowed me to prototype haptic behaviors before exploring more challenging robot pairings.</p>

            <p>When the master and follower robots have different kinematics or degrees of freedom, the joint-space impedance proxy starts to break down.</p>
            <p>To handle these mismatches, I switched to task-space impedance control, with two robots tracking a shared virtual proxy. This formulation is more flexible and lets forces and motions be mapped consistently between very different robots.</p>
            <p>It also allows independent stiffness tuning along each task-space dimension, which becomes useful when coordinating robots with different workspaces or capabilities.</p>
